I like cats and dogs
The baseball player made a nice catch
My cat is named Whiskers
I caught a cold last week
The cat in the hat came back
I was riding in a car with a friend
The caterpillar turned into a butterfly
I have a lot of cats at my house
The waiter brought us our food
The Cat slept on the windowsill
The leaves were scattered all over the yard
