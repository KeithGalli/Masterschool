## Overview

In this lecture session we work through the data analytics case study which can be found [here](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/a-drop-in-user-engagement/).

We use a combination of SQL/Python to dig into the data and provide insights that explain the drop in user engagement.

## Files

Right now there is a starter notebook that can be used to begin work on this task. In a few days I'll upload a more complete version of this file that will have the analysis used to provide reasons for the drop in engagement.
