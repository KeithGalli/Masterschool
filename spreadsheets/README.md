The Google Script file in here is used alongside the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to creative an interactive way to find a city's latitude & longitude. You will need to create your own API key and insert it into the appropriate part of this code in order for things to work.

A good exercise would be trying to connect this script to Google Sheets and get the same end product that I was aiming for at the end of lecture. You should be able to type in a city name, click "Get Latitude/Longitude", and see the spreadsheet update in real time.
